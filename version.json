    "update_notes": "Critical hotfix v1.0.5: Fixed migration execution order. Now checks for pending migrations first and only runs reconciliation if no pending migrations exist. This prevents marking migrations as run before they're actually applied, ensuring database schema is properly updated. Solves the core issue with source_url column missing on hosting environments."
